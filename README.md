<h1>Minimalistic portfolio website for a fashion stylist</h1>
This is a minimalistic portfolio website made for a fashion stylist. It's one of my first React apps, made in July 2019. I've used <strong>React</strong>, <strong>MDBootstrap</strong> and a few other React libraries. It's supposed to have a modal when you click on the <strong> Book</strong>  button, but I deleted it because I want to change it.
